        Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <h3>Question 1: How will the elections in India be conducted?</h3>
        <p>Answer: India has voted in 7 phases from 19th April to 1st June 2024. The results were announced on 4th June 2024.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h3>Question 2: What are the results of the 2024 Indian general elections?</h3>
        <p>Answer: The results of the 2024 Indian general elections are as follows: The BJP-led NDA won 293 seats, while the opposition INDIA alliance, led by Congress, outperformed expectations by winning 234 seats. The results were a shock for the BJP-led NDA, which had exuded confidence before the results with slogans like "Abki Baar 400 Paar." Prime Minister Narendra Modi had expressed confidence during the campaign that the BJP alone could win 370 seats, and the entire NDA would secure 400 seats. However, the INDIA alliance's performance was outstanding, and exit polls wrongly predicted the seat distribution for both alliances.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h3>Question 3: Can BJP form the government this time?</h3>
        <p>Answer: No, the BJP has lost its singular majority in the Lok Sabha. Although the BJP was the single largest party in the Lok Sabha from 2014 to 2024, this time, it needs the support of two important allies: the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) from Andhra Pradesh, which won 16 seats, and Janata Dal United (JDU) from Bihar, which won 12 seats, to form the government.</p>

        <h3>Question 4: What are the biggest shocks for the Bharatiya Janata Party in the states during the 2024 Lok Sabha election?</h3>
        <p>Answer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Uttar Pradesh:</strong> In the 2024 Indian general elections, the BJP won 33 seats, losing 29 seats compared to the previous elections. The entire NDA won 36 seats, losing 28 seats overall. The SP and Congress alliance, which focused on PDA (Pichhada, Dalits, Adivasi), performed well, winning a total of 43 seats. The BSP lost all its 10 seats, and the NDA ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) won 1 seat, while the Azad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram) leader Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan won the Nagina Lok Sabha seat by 1.5 lakh votes.</li>
            <li><strong>Maharashtra:</strong> In the 2024 Indian elections in Maharashtra, the BJP-led NDA, which had formed the state government after the 2022 revolt against Uddhav Thackeray, lost several seats, winning only 18 seats. The INDIA alliance won 30 seats and is leading in 154 assembly seats, which may be sufficient for them to form the government in Maharashtra in the upcoming assembly elections.</li>
            <li><strong>Haryana:</strong> The BJP lost 5 seats, and the Congress gained 5 seats. The BJP's losses were attributed to unfulfilled promises regarding employment and minimum support prices. Both parties ended up tied, winning 5 seats each.</li>

    <h3>Question 7: What came as the biggest shock to the Bharatiya Janata Party in the recently concluded 2024 Indian General Elections?</h3>
    <p>Answer: The biggest shock to the Bharatiya Janata Party was the defeat of their candidate in the Faridabad Lok Sabha Constituency, where two-time sitting MP Lallu Singh lost to Samajwadi Party's Awadhesh Prasad, a Dalit, by 54,397 votes. Despite the Ram Mandir inauguration and BJP's Hindutva politics, the main issues in Ayodhya, such as the removal of houses for the construction of Ram Mandir and unemployment, led to the defeat of BJP's candidate in Faridabad, which includes Ayodhya.</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
    <h3>Question 8: What was the outcome for the Congress in the 2024 Indian general elections?</h3>
    <p>Answer: The Congress improved its tally from 52 seats to 99 seats, surpassing the 55-seat criterion, thereby gaining the post of Leader of the Opposition (LOP). Rahul Gandhi was sworn in as the new Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha on 25th June 2024, after the post had been vacant for 10 years. The Congress significantly improved its position in various states and constituencies by consolidating votes from minorities, Dalits, OBCs, STs, and SCs. The party's revival was greatly influenced by strong campaigning from Rahul Gandhi, President Mallikarjun Kharge, Priyanka Gandhi, and internal galvanization of the party structure in states. While the Congress did not open its account in some states, it has been improving its position, and if the party continues on this path, it may gain power in the next general elections with its allies.</p>

    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <p>The 2024 Indian general election was a direct contest between democracy and dictatorship. While the National Democratic Alliance led by the Bharatiya Janata Party managed to form the government at the center, forming the third Modi ministry on 9th June 2024, the Opposition India Alliance outperformed expectations by winning 234 seats but was unable to form the government.</p>
